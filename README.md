# Amazon Sales Overview | PowerBI

I've designed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard tailored for the Amazon retail landscape. This tool is designed to provide in-depth insights into sales dynamics, product performance, and market trends.

Here's what it offers:

📊 Overview Page: This page displays Amazon's sales landscape, including category performance, shipment statuses, and key metrics like units sold and seller count. We can also visualize sales trends across cities, states, and timeframes for strategic decision-making.

🔍 Product Analysis Page: We can dissect each category to examine product specifics. Tooltips reveal critical data such as sales volume, units sold, return rates, customer reviews, and monthly performance, offering a holistic view of product health.

📈 Product Overview Page: In this page, we can explore all products with a dynamic slicer. Detailed information like title, sales figures, units sold, monthly trends, return impacts, and number of reviews for each product can be accesses via this page. This page is crucial for stakeholders to assess individual product attributes and drive informed actions.

The aim of this report is to provide a vital tool for stakeholders to dissect product specifics and make data-backed decisions.  

You can also find the video presention of this dashboard in the repository.
